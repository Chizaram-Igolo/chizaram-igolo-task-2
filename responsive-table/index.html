            Hello. My name Toluwalope and I'm a programmer at Afried. I've
            always been passionate about finding smarter ways to automate human
            activities. I believe establishing automation and simplification is
            the key to making people become more creative in the future. This
            has been my mindset since I was young and now I see myself actively
            doing what I enjoy. Things I do are running, playing volleyball and
            football, shooting videos, coding, exploring problems and solutions
            I am growing every day, and I'm glad to tell you this is the
            beginning of the goodies to come, look out for me!
